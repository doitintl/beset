# What is KubeIP?

Many applications need to be whitelisted by consumers based on source IP address. As of today, Google Kubernetes Engine doesn't support assigning a static pool of addresses to GKE cluster. kubeIP tries to solve this problem by assigning GKE nodes external IP addresses from a predefined list by continually watching the Kubernetes API for new/removed nodes and applying changes accordingly.

# Deploy kubeIP (without building from source)

If you just want to use KubeIP (instead of building it from source yourself), please follow instructions in this section. You need a Kubernetes 1.10 or newer cluster. You'll also need the Google Cloud SDK. You can install the Google Cloud SDK (which also installs kubectl) [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).

Configure gcloud sdk by setting your default project:

```
gcloud config set project {your project_id}
```

Set the environment variables: 
 
 ```
export GCP_REGION=us-central1
export GKE_CLUSTER_NAME=kubeip-cluster
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)')
```

**Create IAM Service Account and obtain the Key in JSON format**

Create Service Account with this command: 

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create kubeip-service-account --display-name "kubeIP"
```

Create and attach custom kubeip role to the service account by running the following commands:

```
gcloud iam roles create kubeip --project $PROJECT_ID --file roles.yaml

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:kubeip-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role projects/$PROJECT_ID/roles/kubeip
```

Generate the Key using the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
--iam-account kubeip-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
 
**Create Kubernetes Secret**

Get your GKE cluster credentaials with (replace *cluster_name* with your real GKE cluster name):

<pre>
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_CLUSTER_NAME \
--region $GCP_REGION \
--project $PROJECT_ID
</pre> 

Create a Kubernetes secret by running:

```
kubectl create secret generic kubeip-key --from-file=key.json
```
**We need to get RBAC permissions first with**
```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
   --clusterrole cluster-admin --user <user email>
```
**Create static reserved IP addresses:** 

Create as many static IP addresses as at least the number of nodes in your GKE cluster (this example creates 10 addresses) so you will have enough addresses when your cluster scales up (manually or automatically):

```
for i in {1..10}; do gcloud compute addresses create kubeip-ip$i --project=$PROJECT_ID --region=$GCP_REGION; done
```

Add labels to reserved IP addresses. A common practice is to assign a unique value per cluster (for example cluster name).

```
for i in {1..10}; do gcloud beta compute addresses update kubeip-ip$i --update-labels kubeip=$GKE_CLUSTER_NAME --region $GCP_REGION; done
```

<pre>
sed -i "s/reserved/$GKE_CLUSTER_NAME/g" deploy/kubeip-configmap.yaml
</pre>

Make sure the `deploy/kubeip-configmap.yaml` file contains correct values:

 - The `KUBEIP_LABELVALUE` should be your GKE cluster name
 - The `KUBEIP_NODEPOOL` should match the name of your GKE node-pool on which kubeIP will operate
 - The `KUBEIP_FORCEASSIGNMENT` - controls whether kubeIP should assign static IPs to existing nodes in the node-pool and defaults to true

Deploy kubeIP by running: 

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/.
```

After assigning an IP address to a node kubeip will also crate a label for that node `kubip_assigned` with the value of the IP address (`.` are replaced with `_`) 

# Deploy & Build From Source

You need a Kubernetes 1.10 or newer cluster. You also need Docker and kubectl 1.10.x or newer installed on your machine, as well as the Google Cloud SDK. You can install the Google Cloud SDK (which also installs kubectl) [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).


**Clone Git Repository**

Make sure your $GOPATH is [configured](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH). You'll need to clone this repository to your `$GOPATH/src` folder. 

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/doitintl/kubeip
git clone https://github.com/doitintl/kubeip.git $GOPATH/src/doitintl/kubeip
cd $GOPATH/src/doitintl/kubeip
```

**Set Environment Variables**

Replace **us-central1** with the region where your GKE cluster resides and **kubeip-cluster** with your real GKE cluster name

```
export GCP_REGION=us-central1
export GKE_CLUSTER_NAME=kubeip-cluster
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)')
```

**Develop kubeIP locally**

Install go/dep (Go dependency management tool) using [these instructions](https://github.com/golang/dep) and then run

```
dep ensure
```

You can now compile the kubeip binary and run tests

```
make
```

**Build kubeIP's container image**


Compile the kubeIP binary and build the Docker image as following:

```
make image
```

Tag the image using: 

```
docker tag kubeip gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/kubeip
```

Finally, push the image to Google Container Registry with: 

```
docker push gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/kubeip
```

**Create IAM Service Account and obtain the Key in JSON format**

Create Service Account with this command: 

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create kubeip-service-account --display-name "kubeIP"
```

Create and attach custom kubeip role to the service account by running the following commands:

```
gcloud iam roles create kubeip --project $PROJECT_ID --file roles.yaml

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:kubeip-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role projects/$PROJECT_ID/roles/kubeip
```

Generate the Key using the following command:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
--iam-account kubeip-service-account@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
 
**Create Kubernetes Secret**

Get your GKE cluster credentaials with (replace *cluster_name* with your real GKE cluster name):

<pre>
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_CLUSTER_NAME \
--region $GCP_REGION \
--project $PROJECT_ID
</pre> 

Create a Kubernetes secret by running:

```
kubectl create secret generic kubeip-key --from-file=key.json
```

**We need to get RBAC permissions first with**
```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
   --clusterrole cluster-admin --user <user email>
```

**Create static reserved IP addresses:** 

Create as many static IP addresses as at least the number of nodes in your GKE cluster (this example creates 10 addresses) so you will have enough addresses when your cluster scales up (manually or automatically):

```
for i in {1..10}; do gcloud compute addresses create kubeip-ip$i --project=$PROJECT_ID --region=$GCP_REGION; done
```

Add labels to reserved IP addresses. A common practice is to assign a unique value per cluster (for example cluster name).

```
for i in {1..10}; do gcloud beta compute addresses update kubeip-ip$i --update-labels kubeip=$GKE_CLUSTER_NAME --region $GCP_REGION; done
```

Adjust the deploy/kubeip-configmap.yaml with your GKE cluster name (replace the gke-cluster-name with your real GKE cluster name

<pre>
sed -i "s/reserved/$GKE_CLUSTER_NAME/g" deploy/kubeip-configmap.yaml
</pre>

Adjust the `deploy/kubeip-deployment.yaml` to reflect your real container image path:

 - Edit the `image` to match your container image path, i.e. `gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/kubeip`

By default, kubeIP will only manage the nodes in default-pool nodepool. If you'd like kubeIP to manage another nood-pool, please update the `KUBEIP_NODEPOOL` setting in `deploy/kubeip-configmap.yaml` file before deploying. You can also update the `KUBEIP_LABELKEY` and `KUBEIP_LABELVALUE` to control which static external IP addresses the kubeIP will look for to assign to your nodes. 

The `KUBEIP_FORCEASSIGNMENT` which defaults to true will check on startup and every 5 minutes if there are some nodes in the node-pool that are not assigned to a reserved address. If such nodes will be found then kubeIP will assign a reserved address (if one is available to them)

Deploy kubeIP by running 

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/.
```
